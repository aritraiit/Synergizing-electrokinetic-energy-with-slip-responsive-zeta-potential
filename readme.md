## ðŸ“– Overview

This work presents a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study on the interplay between:
- **Slip-dependent zeta potential** at channel walls  
- **Non-Newtonian fluid rheology** modeled using the Carreauâ€“Yasuda relation  

We numerically solved the fully-coupled **Poissonâ€“Boltzmann** and **momentum equations** using the Finite Element Method (FEM) and provided perturbation-based analytical solutions for low Weissenberg numbers.

Key findings:
- Pseudo-plastic fluids (`n < 1`) enhance the induced streaming potential and energy conversion efficiency.
- A non-monotonic relation exists between slip length and flow velocity due to competing slip and electrokinetic retardation effects.
- Maximum electrokinetic efficiency can be enhanced by >250% through synergistic tuning of slip length and rheology.
